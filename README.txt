# This model was written to self-consistently solve for polarization, charge density, and potential of an electron-doped perovskite ferroelectric.

# It was done as part of a Master of Science in Materials Science program at Trent University by Brennan Cornell, Department of Physics and Astronomy, August 2023.

# The model is written in FORTRAN.  It requires the BLAS and LAPACK libraries to be compiled correctly (not included).

# The data.txt, archive.txt and import.txt files are deliberately empty.  The data.txt and archive.txt files are output files for the model.  The import.txt file is an optional input if the "import" flag is set to true in Coefficients.mod. 

# Details on the model, and how to compile it correctly are found in the thesis - "Effect of t2g orbitals on domain walls in electron-doped perovskite ferroelectrics."
